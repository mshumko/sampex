Easily download, load and plot data from the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite that operated from 1992-2012. This library currently downloads and loads data from the `HILT`, `PET`, and `LICA` instruments, as well as the `attitide` files. If the files don't exist locally, `sampex` will search for them `online`_.
